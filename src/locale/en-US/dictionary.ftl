  | <p>OpenStax believes that everyone has something to learn, and everyone has something to teach.</p>
  |
  | <p>Frustrated by the limitations of traditional textbooks and courses, Dr. Richard Baraniuk
  | founded OpenStax (then Connexions) in 1999 at Rice University to provide authors and learners with
  | an open space where they can share and freely adapt educational materials such as courses, books, and reports. </p>
  |
  | <p>Today, OpenStax CNX is a dynamic non-profit digital ecosystem serving millions of users per month in the delivery
  | of educational content to improve learning outcomes.</p>
  |
  | <p>There are tens of thousands of learning objects, called <b>pages</b>, that are organized into thousands
  | of textbook-style <b>books</b> in a host of disciplines, all easily accessible online and downloadable to almost
  | any device, anywhere, anytime.</p>
  |
  | <p>The best part? Everything is available for free thanks to generous support from Rice University and several
  | philanthropic organizations.</p>

  | <p>OpenStax CNX is designed to encourage the sharing and reuse of educational content. The knowledge in OpenStax CNX
  | can be shared and built upon by all because it is reusable:</p>
  | <ul>
  | <li><b>educationally:</b>
  | We encourage authors to write each page to stand on its own so that others can easily use it in different
  | collections and contexts specially designed for their students.</li>
  |
  | <li><b>technologically:</b>
  | all content is built in a simple semantic HTML5 format rich with built-in accessibility features to ensure it can
  | all be read by everyone. Also the OpenStax CNX toolset makes it easy for author to create and adapt content using
  | a word processor similar to Google Docs or Word.</li>
  |
  | <li><b>legally:</b>
  | all content produced in OpenStax is available under a Creative Commons open-content licenses.
  | This makes it easy for authors to share their work - allowing others to use and reuse it legally - while still
  | getting recognition and attribution for their efforts. The OpenStax CNX software maintains attribution to the
  | original author for you, making remixing a cinch.</li>
